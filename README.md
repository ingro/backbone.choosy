# Backbone.Choosy

## Synopsis

This plugins is in fact a simply port written in ES6 of the excellent (but not maintained lately) [Backbone.Chooser](https://github.com/brian-mann/Backbone.Chooser) by Brian Mann. I forked his work primarily to add the support for UMD since I needed it to work both with AMD and CommonJS modules, but if I have time I will also look at the open issues and pull requests of the original plugin and try to integrate them, if it makes sense.
